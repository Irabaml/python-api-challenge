with vacation challenge, I supposed to create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city. Then narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.

I also created the new data frame called hotel_df by copying the original dataframe and adding column called Hotel Name which helped me to insert the first name of hotels located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates by using Geopify API.

After that, Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.Â¶
